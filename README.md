# 🔐 Image Steganography Tool  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Python-based steganography tool** that allows users to **hide and retrieve secret messages** inside images using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography**. It provides a **password-protected encryption** mechanism to ensure **secure communication** and a **Tkinter GUI** for an easy-to-use interface.

## ✨ Features  
✔️ **Secure Message Hiding** – Uses **LSB steganography** to embed hidden text inside images.  
✔️ **Password Protection** – Only users with the correct password can retrieve the hidden message.  
✔️ **Undetectable Data Concealment** – The image appears unchanged after encryption.  
✔️ **Supports PNG & JPEG** – Works with common image formats.  
✔️ **User-Friendly GUI** – Built with **Tkinter** for a simple and interactive experience.
