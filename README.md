# Secure-Data-Hiding-In-Images-Using-Steganography
This project is a Python-based steganography tool that allows users to hide and retrieve secret messages in images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. It provides an easy-to-use Tkinter GUI for encrypting messages into images and decrypting them later with a password.
